# This workflow automatically drafts new project releases so it is obvious

# It takes advantage of the labels used in Patina to automatically categorize
# the types of changes in a given release. In addition, the semantic version of
# the code is constantly maintained based on Patina label conventions to ensure
# semantic versioning is followed and a release version is always ready.
